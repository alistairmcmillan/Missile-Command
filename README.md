Missile-Command
===============

Developed by Mark Pazolli (http://www.pazolli.org/), Missile Command was intended as a Cocoa code demo.

This is a minor update of Mark's Missile Command to get it compiling with a current version of Xcode (v4.6.3) on a current version of OS X (v10.8.4).

The original code is available [here](http://www.pazolli.org/software.php), along with some of Mark's other projects.
